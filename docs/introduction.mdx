## Overview

**Hermis** is a framework-agnostic, headless wallet adapter library for Solana that gives developers complete control over wallet integration in your dApp.

Unlike traditional wallet adapters that include pre-designed UI components, Hermis provides raw wallet functionality; authentication, transaction signing, and wallet management, without including any UI opinions or design limitations.

**Use any framework.** React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, or vanilla JavaScript.
**Style however you want.** Tailwind, Material-UI, styled-components, or custom CSS.
**Craft the experience your users deserve.** Complete creative freedom, no compromises.

This SDK provides the building blocks. You provide the vision.

## Built for Solana's Ecosystem

Hermis works seamlessly with both **@solana/web3.js** and **@solana/kit**, Anza's next-generation Solana JavaScript SDK (successor to web3.js).

By exposing **compatible APIs** and maintaining **backward compatibility**, Hermis ensures **zero breaking changes** when switching libraries. Your wallet integration code remains identical whether you are building with the predecessor or porting over to the modern toolkit, upgrade at your convenience.
